Details[edit] He was 18 years old, and a Driver in the 37th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 26 August 1914 at Le Cateau, France, when a captain (Douglas Reynolds) of the same battery was trying to save two guns which had been recaptured, Driver Luke and another driver (Job Henry Charles Drain) volunteered to help and gave great assistance in the eventual saving of one of the guns. At the time they were under heavy fire from the enemy who were only 100 yards (91 m) away.[1] He later achieved the rank of sergeant and served during World War II as a ground gunner with the Royal Air Force. Fred Luke was a guest of honour of 93 Le cateau Field Battery shortly before his death when members of the battery were awed to meet this living legend. Gnrs Raymond Pulman and Peter Jackson formed a special guard of honour on that proud day. For a number of years until his death on 12 March 1983, Frederick Luke was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest living holder of the Victoria Cross. The medal[edit] His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London. References[edit] ^ "No. 28985". The London Gazette (Supplement). 24 November 1914. p. 9957.
