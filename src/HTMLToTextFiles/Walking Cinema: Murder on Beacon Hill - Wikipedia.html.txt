The case was the first one to use the budding science of forensics. The iPhone application was recognized to be the first iPhone application to be accepted to a major film festival,[1] based on the PBS documentary, Murder at Harvard.[2] The application is a mixed-reality storytelling experience, combining a roughly one-mile walk with audio, video,[3] a live map and location-based adventures[4] to guide participants through the story.[5] Cast and crew[edit] Name Role Michael Epstein Writer, director Eric Stange Writer, Collaborating Director Caitlin Mailly Producer Laura Pirano Producer, cinematographer, editor, art director, Digital Effects, Animator Sasha Mandel Original Music, Sound Editor Michael Born Map Animation and Renderings Raizlabs Application Design and Software Development Susi Walsh Project Coordinator Brooke Scibelli Production Assistant Alexandra McDougall Narrator Paul Logan, Jr. Additional Voices S.
