Generic ballot polling provides a look at the overall political environment, but since members of Congress are elected from individual districts, a party’s share of support in such a national poll may not directly correlate to the number of seats they win in the U.S. House. A close divide in generic ballot preferences often signals Republican gains in the House.

The latest Poll of Polls includes results from Washington Post/ABC (10/30-11/02), CNN (10/26-10/31), NPR/PBS/Marist (10/24-10/27), CBS/YouGov (10/26-10/28).
